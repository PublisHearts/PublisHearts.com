        <p>At PublisHearts, quality matters.</p>

        <p>
          Unlike large mass-market retailers, our books are not bulk-produced or warehouse-stocked in high volume. To
          ensure the highest quality, we order and maintain a small, carefully reviewed inventory. Each shipment is
          personally checked for printing quality before being prepared for customers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also offer custom packaging that Amazon does not provide. Orders placed directly through PublisHearts may
          include curated extras such as stickers, accessories, and protective packaging to ensure your books arrive
          safely and beautifully presented.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because we maintain limited stock to preserve quality control, delivery times may occasionally be longer. If
          inventory runs low, there may be a short delay while we receive new copies from our supplier, inspect them,
          carefully package your order, and prepare it for shipment.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you prefer faster shipping and do not require exclusive accessories or custom packaging, you may order
          directly through Amazon:

          </a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Please note that Amazon orders do not include website-exclusive extras and are fulfilled using Amazon's
          standard packaging and shipping methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          We appreciate your patience and your support of independent publishing. Every direct order helps us continue
          creating meaningful stories with care and intention.
