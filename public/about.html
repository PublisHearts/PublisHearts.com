        <h1>About PublisHearts</h1>

        <p>PublisHearts began with a simple belief: small pages can hold very big dreams.</p>

        <p>
          In a world where books are often mass-produced and shipped without care, PublisHearts was created to bring
          intention back to storytelling. Every book is crafted with heart - from the warmth of the illustrations to
          the meaning behind each word.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe stories should inspire curiosity, encourage imagination, and help children notice the beauty in
          the world around them. Whether it is adventure, learning, or quiet encouragement, each title is designed to
          feel thoughtful, safe, and lasting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike large retailers, we maintain small, quality-checked inventory to ensure the best possible print
          experience. Orders placed directly through our store may include special touches and exclusive extras that
          reflect our commitment to meaningful storytelling.
        </p>

        <p>PublisHearts is not just about selling books.</p>
        <p>It is about building confidence, curiosity, and connection - one story at a time.</p>
